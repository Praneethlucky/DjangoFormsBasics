<h1>Dataset for Chemical reaction:</h1>
The atomic weights are available for elements 1 through 118 and isotopic compositions or abundances are given when appropriate. The atomic weights data were published by J. Meija et al in Atomic Weights of the Elements 2013, and the isotopic compositions data were published by M. Berglund and M.E. Wieser in Isotopic Compositions of the Elements 2009. The relative atomic masses of the isotopes data were published by M. Wang, G. Audi, A.H. Wapstra, F.G. Kondev, M. MacCormick, X. Xu1, and B. Pfeiffer in The AME2012 Atomic Mass Evaluation.
